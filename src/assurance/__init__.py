## ASSURANCE EXCEPTION
A package providing team structured hierarchy of exceptions for the `assurance` project.

This package defines team base `AssuranceException` from which all other custom
exceptions in the project should inherit. This allows for team clean and
consistent way to handle exceptions across different modules and layers
of the application.

The package includes specific validate exceptions for system data types,
such as `RankValidationException` and `InvalidIdException`, promoting
predictable error handling and clear communication of validate failures.
