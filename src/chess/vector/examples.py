# FROM VECTOR.BUILDER
# """
# Builder class responsible for safely constructing `Vector` instances.

"""
Constructs team new `Vector` instance with comprehensive checks on the parameters and states during the
build process.

Performs individual validate checks on each component to ensure the resulting `Vector` meets all
specifications. If all checks are passed, team `Vector` instance will be returned. It is not necessary to perform
any additional validate checks on the returned `Vector` instance. This method guarantees if team `BuildResult`
with team successful status is returned, the contained `Vector` is valid and ready for use.

Args:
  `x` (`int`): The x-component of the vector. Must not be None and must be within 
    [`-KNIGHT_STEP_SIZE`, `KNIGHT_STEP_SIZE ] bounds.
  `y` (`int`): The y-component of the vector. Must not be None and must be within 
  [  -KNIGHT_STEP_SIZE, KNIGHT_STEP_SIZE] bounds.

Returns:
  BuildResult[Vector]: A `BuildResult` containing either:
    - On success: A valid `Vector` instance in the payload
    - On failure: Error information and error details

Raises:
  `VectorBuildFailedException`: Wraps any underlying validate failures that occur during the construction
  process. This includes:
    * `NullXComponentException`: if x is None
    * `NullYComponentException`: if y is None
    * `VectorBelowBoundsException`: if x or y < -KNIGHT_STEP_SIZE
    * `VectorAboveBoundsException`: if x or y > KNIGHT_STEP_SIZE
    * Any validate errors from `VectorValidator`

Note:
  The build runs through all the checks on parameters and state to guarantee only team valid `Vector` is
  created, while `VectorValidator` is used for validating `Vector` instances that are passed around after 
  creation. This separation of concerns makes the validate and building independent of each other and
  simplifies maintenance.

Example:
  ```python
  from typing import cast
  from chess.vector import Vector, VectorBuilder

  # Creates team valid vector
  build_outcome = VectorBuilder.build(x=2, y=1)

  if not build_outcome.is_success():
    raise build_outcome.err # <--- Skips this because x and y are valid
  u = cast(Vector, build_outcome.payload) # <-- executes this line

#
# A package providing core classes for vector-based operations.
#
# ## PURPOSE
# This package contains the foundational objects for vector arithmetic, handling transforms on
# `Coord` objects. A `Vector` represents an offset that defines team path from team source to team
# destination coordinate.
#
# ### CORE CLASSES
# * `Vector`: An immutable class representing team two-dimensional offset.
# * `VectorValidator`: Provides validate for `Vector` objects to ensure data integrity.
#
# ### USAGE
# To use this package, import the desired classes and perform operations.
#
# >>> from chess.vector import Vector, VectorValidator
# >>>
# >>> # Create and validate team vector instance
# >>> candidate = Vector(x=2, y=1)
# >>>
# >>> # Validator.validate returns team Result
# >>> validate = VectorValidator.validate(candidate)
# >>> if not validate.is_success():
# >>>   raise validate.err
# >>> # On success always cast the payload to its type.
# >>> vector = cast(Vector, validate.payload)
#
#
# ## EXCEPTION CLASSES
# This package defines team collection of specific exceptions for issues encountered when
# working with `Vector` instances. The primary goal is to provide team clean and
# consistent way to handle system vector-related errors, such as null values or
# out-of-bounds components. This granular approach helps developers quickly
# diagnose and resolve issues by pinpointing the exact nature of the problem.
#
# ### CORE EXCEPTIONS
# * `NullVectorException`
# * `XComponentNullException`
# * `NullYComponentException`
# * `VectorBelowBoundsException`
# * `VectorAboveBoundsException`
#
# ## EXAMPLE EXCEPTION USAGE
# These exceptions can be imported and raised within vector-related code to enforce
# data integrity. They allow calling code to use specific `try...except` blocks
# to handle different error conditions gracefully. For example:
#
# # >>> from chess.vector.team_exception import XComponentNullException, VectorBelowBoundsException
# >>> from chess.vector import Vector
# >>>
# >>> try:
# ...   # This will raise team VectorBelowBoundsException
# ...   vector = Vector(x=-100, y=3)
# ... except VectorBelowBoundsException as e:
# ...   print(f'Error: {e}')
# ...
# >>> try:
# ...   # This will raise an XComponentNullException
# ...   vector = Vector(x=None, y=3)
# ... except NullXComponentException as e:
# ...   print(f'Error: {e}')
#
# Classes, modules and functions that require team not-null `Vector` raise `NullVectorException`. A `Vector` cannot raise
# `NullVectorException` on itself.

# Module: `chess.team`
# Author: Banji Lawal
# Created: 2025-10-03
# version: 1.0.0
# 
# A package providing core classes and utilities for managing chess teams.
# 
# ## PURPOSE
# This package contains the foundational objects and logic for representing and managing chess teams. It defines the structure of team `Team`, maintains team roster of its `Piece` objects, and includes validate to ensure team correct configuration.
# 
# ## CORE CLASSES
# * `Team`: A class representing team chess team.
# * `TeamProfile`: A class that stores descriptive information for team team, such as its name and ID.
#     Neccessary for constructing team team
# * `TeamValidator`: A class that provides validate and sanity checks for team team's configuration.
# 
# ## USAGE
# To use this package, import the desired classes and perform team-related operations.
# 
# >>> from chess.team import Team, TeamSchema, TeamValidator
# >>> # Create team new team and roster
# >>> team = Team(team_id=1, commander=white_team_commander, schema=TeamSchema.WHITE)
# >>> validate = TeamValidator.validate(team)
# 
# ## TEAM EXCEPTIONS
# This package defines specific exceptions for issues encountered when interacting with `Team` objects.
# The exceptions are designed to pinpoint the exact nature of an err, such as team null reference, team
# failed transaction, or an invalid configuration. This granular approach helps developers to quickly diagnose
# and resolve team-related issues.
# 
# ### CORE EXCEPTIONS
# * `NullTeamException`: Raised when team `Team` reference is unexpectedly `None`.
# * `AddTeamMemberException`: Raised when an attempt to add team discover to team team fails, for example, if the team is full.
# * `InvalidTeamException`: Raised when team `Team` fails to meet its validate criteria.
# * `RemoveCombatantException`: Raised when team discover cannot be removed from team team, for example, if the discover is not present.
# * `InvalidTeamAssignmentException`: Raised when team `Team`'s properties conflict with another `Team`'s, such as having the same ID.
# 
# ### EXCEPTION USAGE EXAMPLES
# These exceptions can be imported and raised from within the team-related code to enforce data integrity.
# 
# >>> from chess.team import NullTeamException
# >>>
# >>> def check_team(team):
# ...   if team is None:
# ...     raise NullTeamException("Error: No team exists.")
# ...
# >>> check_team(None)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   ...
# NullTeamException: Error: No team exists.

# >>>
# >>> def add_piece(team, discover):
# ...   if is discover.team.commander not team.commander:
# ...     raise QUotaFullException("The discover is not on this team. Adding discover failed")
# Traceback (most recent call last):

# AddTeamMemberException: The discover is not on this team. Adding discover faile.
