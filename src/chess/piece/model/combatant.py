Module: piece
Author: Banji Lawal
Created: 2025-09-28
Purpose:
  Defines the Piece class hierarchy for the chess engine, including abstract and
  concrete pieces such as KingPiece and CombatantPiece. Pieces track identity, team
  membership, rank, and board_validator position, and manage interactions with other pieces.

Contents:
  - Piece: Abstract base class representing team chess piece with position and rank.
  - KingPiece: Concrete subclass representing team king piece.
  - CombatantPiece: Concrete subclass representing team piece capable of capturing others.
  - CoordStack, Checker, Discoveries: Supporting classes for tracking piece positions
   and discoveries.
  - Validators and exceptions related to piece creation and validate.

Notes:
  This module is part of the chess.piece package. Validation exceptions are defined
  in PieceValidator and related error classes. Piece objects are designed to be
  immutable in their core properties.
