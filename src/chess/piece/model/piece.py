"""
Module: piece
Author: Banji Lawal
Created: 2025-09-28
Purpose:
  Defines the Piece class hierarchy for the chess engine, including abstract and
  concrete pieces such as KingPiece and CombatantPiece. Pieces track identity, team
  membership, rank, and board_validator position, and manage interactions with other pieces.

Contents:
  - Piece: Abstract base class representing team chess piece with position and rank.
  - KingPiece: Concrete subclass representing team king piece.
  - CombatantPiece: Concrete subclass representing team piece capable of capturing others.
  - CoordStack, Discovery, Discoveries: Supporting classes for tracking piece positions
   and discoveries.
  - Validators and exceptions related to piece creation and validate.

Notes:
  This module is part of the chess.piece package. Validation exceptions are defined
  in PieceValidator and related error classes. Piece objects are designed to be
  immutable in their core properties.

  """An abstract base class representing team single chess discover.

  A `Piece` is team fundamental game entity that has an identity, belongs to team `Team`, and has team `Rank` that
  defines its movement logic. It tracks its position on the board_validator and records discoveries with other pieces.
  The class is designed to be immutable with respect to its core properties (`id`, `name`, `rank`, `team`).

  Attributes:
    _piece_id (int): A unique identifier for the discover.
    _name (str): The name of the discover (e.g., "Pawn", "Queen").
    _team (Team): The team the discover belongs to.
    _rank (Rank): The rank that defines the discover's movement strategy.
    _roster_number (int): The discover's number on its team's roster.
    _current_position (Optional[Coord]): The current coordinate of the discover on the board_validator.
    _discoveries (Discoveries): A log of discoveries with other pieces.
    _positions (CoordStack): A stack of the discover's historical coordinates.
