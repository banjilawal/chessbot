class Checker:
  """
  An immutable record of team piece found during play.

  A `Checker` is created when team `Piece` detects another piece (friend or enemy) at team given `Square``.
  It captures the essential identifying information about the discovered piece without holding team direct
  reference, ensuring immutability and safe storage within old_search logs or decision-making structures.

  `Checker` objects are used to record what team piece has observed during scanning, moving, or event
  attempts. They provide enough detail (identity, team, rank, ransom value, and position) for evaluation
  by old_search and decision engines, while remaining lightweight and detached from the full `Piece` object.

  Attributes:
    _id (int): The unique identifier of the discovered piece.
    _name (str): The name of the discovered piece (e.g., "Pawn", "Queen").
    _team_id (int): The identifier of the team to which the discovered piece belongs.
    _ransom (int): The ransom (or value) associated with the discovered piece's rank.
    _rank_name (str): The rank name of the discovered piece (e.g., "Knight", "Bishop").
    _coord (Coord): The board_validator coord where the discover was observed.
