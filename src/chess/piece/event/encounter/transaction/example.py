version: 1.0.0

# SECTION 1 - Purpose:
This module provides:
  1. A satisfaction of the `ChessBot` integrity requirement.
  2. A satisfaction of the `ChessBot` reliability requirement.

# SECTION 2 - Scope:
The module's only covers exceptions raised by `IdValidator`;

# SECTION 3: Limitations
  1. Does not provide logic for fixing the errors or causing the exception being raised.
       `IdValidator` is responsible for the logic which raises these exceptions.

# SECTION 4 - Design Considerations and Themes:
The major theme influencing the modules design are
  1. Single responsibility.
  2. Discoverability.
  3. Encapsulations.

# SECTION 5- Features Supporting Requirements:
  1. The ability to handle errors without crashing the application is a reliability feature.


# SECTION 6 - Feature Delivery Mechanism:
1. Exceptions specific to verifying ids.

# SECTION 7 - Dependencies:
* From `chess.system`:
    `ChessException`, `ContextException`, `ResultException`

# SECTION 8 - Contains:
See the list of exceptions in the `__all__` list following (e.g., `EventException`,`TransactionException`).

Module: chess.vector.exception
Author: Banji Lawal
Created: 2025-10-04
version: 1.0.0

SCOPE:
-----
This module is exclusively for defining all custom **exception classes** that are specific to the
creation, validation, and manipulation of `Vector` objects.

**Limitations** It does not contain any logic for raising these exceptions; that responsibility
`Vector`, `VectorBuilder`, and `VectorValidator`

THEME:
-----
* Granular, targeted error reporting
* Wrapping exceptions

**Design Concepts**:
  1. Each field and behavior in the `Vector` class has an exception specific to its possible
      state, outcome, or behavior.

PURPOSE:
-------
1. Centralized error dictionary for the `Vector` domain.
2. Fast debugging using highly granular exception messages and naming to
    find the source.
3. Providing understandable, consistent information about failures originating from
    the `Vector` domain.
4. Providing a clear distinction between errors related to `Vector` instances and
    errors from Python, the Operating System or elsewhere in the `ChessBot` application.

DEPENDENCIES:
------------
Requires base exception classes and constants from the core system:
From `chess.system`:
  * Exceptions: `ChessException`, `ValidationException`, `NullException`,
        `BuildFailedException`.

CONTAINS:
--------
See the list of exceptions in the `__all__` list following (e.g., `VectorException`,
`NullVectorException`, `InvalidVectorException`, ).
