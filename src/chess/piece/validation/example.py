Module: chess.piece.validation.piece
Author: Banji Lawal
Created: 2025-10-22
Version: 1.0.0

# SECTION 1 - Application Requirements Satisfactions:
This module provides a satisfaction of the `ChessBot` integrity requirement.

# SECTION 2 - Module Scope:
Validation service for `Piece` entities.

# SECTION 3 - Module Limitations:
  1. The module does not provide any actionable code.
  2. The module is limited to providing a framework for validating integrity of existing objects.
  3. The module does not provide any enforceable polices on entities using the framework.

# SECTION 4 - Major Design Concerns:
The major theme influencing the modules design are
  1. separating entity responsibilities into from implementation details.
  2. Loose coupling of modules while maintaining a unified, consistent interface for high cohesion among components
    that have no direct relationship with each other.
  3. A consistent interface and aids discoverability, understanding and simplicity.

# SECTION 5 - User Facing Features Supporting Requirements:
1. No direct support for any user level features.

# SECTION 6 - Developer Features Supporting Requirements:
1. Minimal implementation complexity.
2. Direct support for easy, fast, scalable enhancements.

# SECTION G - API Component Implementation:
The module provides an interface individual entities can use to for solving their optimal verification sub-problems
 providing a global solution if implementations cover every verifiable component.

# SECTION 7 - Dependencies:
* From `chess.system`:
    `ValidationResult`, `Validator`

* From Python `abc` Library:
    `ABC`, `abstractmethod`

* From Python `typing` Library:
    `cast`, `TypeVar`, `Any`

# SECTION 8 - Contains:
1. `PieceValidator`

# ROLE: Validation, Integrity, Consistency

# RESPONSIBILITIES:
  1. Ensure an entity meets minimal requirements for being a valid `Piece` before its used in the
      application.
  2. Minimal data integrity checks on collections organic to `Piece` objects.
  3. Minimal consistency check for `Piece`-`Team` binding.

# PROVIDES:
`ValidationResult`: Containing verified `Piece` or error information about requirement violations.

# ATTRIBUTES:
  None
"""
"""
# ACTION:
Verify the `candidate` is a valid ID. The Application requires
1. Candidate is not null.
2. Is a positive integer.

# PARAMETERS:
    * `candidate` (`Any`):

# RETURNS:
`ValidationResult[str]`: A `ValidationResult` containing either:
    `'payload'` (`Piece`) - An item satisfying minimal requirements for a `Piece` object used in the application.
    `exception` (`Exception`) - An exception detailing which specification violation occurred.

# RAISES:
Nothing - All exceptions are caught and returned in the `ValidationResult`.
