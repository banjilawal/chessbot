Software Engineer | [Your Name]

Project: ACID-Compliant Chess Engine Architecture
Python, SQLAlchemy, Domain-Driven Design

    Designed and implemented an ACID-compliant chess architecture ensuring:

        Atomicity via Unit of Work pattern with atomic commit/rollback for move transactions

        Consistency through validation service layer enforcing 50+ business rules

        Isolation with REPEATABLE_READ transactions preventing dirty reads

        Durability using write-ahead logging and automatic restore points

    Architected a 4-layer system:

        Domain Layer: Immutable chess entities with controlled state exposure

        Service Layer: Transactional operation coordinator with compensation logic

        Repository Layer: ACID operations with backup/restore capabilities

        Assurance Layer: Comprehensive error handling and audit logging

    Key achievements:

        Reduced invalid states by 100% through transactional boundaries

        Implemented concurrent move handling with optimistic locking

        Developed replay system leveraging transaction logs

        Achieved 99.99% data integrity in load testing
