Module: chess.system.validate.validator

# SECTION 1 - Purpose:
This module provides a satisfaction of the `ChessBot` integrity requirement.

# SECTION 2 - Scope:
The module covers all domains in the `ChessBot` application.

# SECTION 3 - Limitations:
  1. The module does not provide any actionable code.
  2. The module is limited to providing a framework for validating integrity of existing objects.
  3. The module does not provide any enforceable polices on entities using the framework.

# SECTION 4 - Design Considerations and Themes:
The major theme influencing the modules design are
  1. separating entity responsibilities into from implementation details.
  2. Loose coupling of modules while maintaining a unified, consistent interface for high cohesion among components
    that have no direct relationship with each other.
  3. A consistent interface and aids discoverability, understanding and simplicity.

# SECTION 5 - Features Supporting Requirements:
1. No direct support for any user level features.
2. Direct support for easy, fast, scalable enhancements.

# SECTION G - Feature Delivery Mechanism:
The module provides an interface individual entities can use to for solving their optimal verification sub-problems
 providing a global solution if implementations cover every verifiable component.

# SECTION 7 - Dependencies:
* From `chess.system`:
    `ValidationResult`

* From Python `abc` Library:
    `ABC`, `abstractmethod`

* From Python `typing` Library:
    `Generic`, `TypeVar`, `Any`

# SECTION 8 - Contains:
1. `Validator`
