# SECTION 1 - Purpose:
1. This module provides a satisfaction of the `ChessBot` consistency requirement. The module supplies consistency
      by providing a features for rollback activities.
    enforcement of regulations for unique IDs in the system.

# SECTION 2 - Scope:
The module only covers the basic properties and behavior objects in the `Event` domain.

# SECTION 3 - Limitations:
  1. Do not use this module directly. A stateful entity is responsible for
        * Having `Builders` which create subclasses for each state the entity has in its lifecycle.
        * Having `Validators` that ensure a transition will be successful.
  1. This module does not have any logic for executing a `Transaction` that changes an entity's state. Module
      `chess.system.event.transaction` is responsible for the `Event` lifecycle.
  2. The module does not verify the correctness of data control or routing information it contains. Directly using the
      module can breach data integrity, propagate inconsistencies or negatively impact performance. Use a
        * `Builder` for the
      DO NOT USE THE MODULE DIRECTLY. is not responsible for verifying the uniqueness of an ID. the `AutoId` class in
      `chess.system.id.auto_id` module.
  1. The module is not responsible for supplying or publishing IDs that meet system requirements.
      For details about publishing IDs see the `AutoId` class in module `chess.system.id.auto_id`.

# SECTION 4 - Design Considerations and Themes:
Major themes influencing the design include:
1. Easy and fast debugging.
2. Single responsibility, single source of truth.

# SECTION 5 - Features Supporting Requirements:
1. No direct support for any user level features.
2. Direct support for reliability, verification, and integrity.

# SECTION G - Feature Delivery Mechanism:
1. An exception for each requirement providing granular, accurate and precise error reporting.
2. Minimizing the boilerplate error handling and logging code with the `LoggingLevelRouter` decorator.
3. `IdValidator` can be used as component in more complex verifications.

# SECTION 7 - Dependencies:
* From `chess.system`:
    `ExecutionContext`,

* From Python `typing` Library:
    `Generic`, `TypeVar`, `Optional`

# SECTION 8 - Contains:
1. `Transaction`
