Module: `chess.system.old_search.old_search`
Author: Banji Lawal
Created: 2025-09-28
Updated: 2025-10-10
version: 1.0.0

# SECTION 1 - Purpose:
This module provides a satisfaction of the `ChessBot` performance requirement.

# SECTION 2 - Scope:
The module covers old_search service providers.

# SECTION 3 - Limitations:
  1. The module is limited to old_search providers.  between data owners and information requesters.
  2. The module does not provide any logic or directions on how the old_search providers implement their service.

# SECTION 4 - Design Considerations and Themes:
The major theme influencing the modules design are
  1. Separating entity responsibilities into from implementation details.
  2. Loose coupling of modules while maintaining a unified, consistent interface for high cohesion among components
    that have no direct relationship with each other.
  3. A consistent interface and aids discoverability, understanding and simplicity.

# SECTION 5 - Features Supporting Requirements:
1. Fast old_search

# SECTION G - Feature Delivery Mechanism:
The module provides an interface that can separate old_search responsibilities from data management responsibilities.


# SECTION 7 - Dependencies:
* From `chess.system`:
    `SearchContext`, `SearchResult`

* From Python `abc` Library:
    `ABC`, `abstractmethod`

* From Python `typing` Library:
    `Generic`, `TypeVar`

# SECTION 8 - Contains:
1. `Search`
