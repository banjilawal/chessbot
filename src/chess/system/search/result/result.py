Module: `chess.system.old_search.transaction`

# SECTION 1 - Purpose:
This module provides:
  1. A satisfaction of the `ChessBot` reliability requirement.
  2. A satisfaction of the performance requirement.

# SECTION 2 - Scope:
The module covers clients servers, and data owners in the `ChessBot` old_search domain.

# SECTION 3 - Limitations:
  1. The module is limited to presenting the answer from a `Search` service provider to the client delivering a query.
  2. The module does not guarantee the accuracy or precision of data in the transaction.

# SECTION 4 - Design Considerations and Themes:
The major theme influencing the modules design are
  1. Single responsibility.
  2. A consistent interface aiding discoverability, understanding and simplicity.

# SECTION 5 - Features Supporting Requirements:
  1. The ability to handle errors without crashing the application is a reliability feature.
  2. Performance does not degrade under high old_search loads.

# 6 Feature Delivery Mechanism:
  1. The module implements logic for carrying either an exception or transaction of a successful old_search. in the same
      container. This improves resource.
  2. Delivering an exception in the return instead of raising gives application higher reliability, uptimes and
      survivability.

# SECTION 7 - Dependencies:
* From `chess.system`:
    `Result`

* From Python `typing` Library:
    `Generic`, `TypeVar`, `Optional`

# SECTION 8 - Contains:
1. `SearchResult`

  # RESPONSIBILITIES:
  1. Carry results to the query requestor.
  2. Indicate an empty old_search transaction with an object that has neither a payload nor an exception.

  Answer from the `Search` service provider containing either:
    1. Matches to the client's query.
    2. An exception raised during the old_search process or query submission.
    3. A transaction containing neither an exception nor a payload indicating no matches were found.
