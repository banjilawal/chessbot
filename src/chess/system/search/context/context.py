# SECTION 1 - Purpose:
This module provides a satisfaction of the  `ChessBot` performance requirement.

# SECTION 2 - Scope:
The module covers search service providers, data owners and information requesters.

# SECTION 3 - Limitations:
  1. The module does not provide any attributes or actionable code. Properties in a
     data owner's collection determine what is in the SearchContext

# SECTION 4 - Design Considerations and Themes:
The major theme influencing the modules design are
  1. separating entity responsibilities into from implementation details.
  2. Loose coupling of modules while maintaining a unified, consistent interface for high cohesion among components
    that have no direct relationship with each other.
  3. A consistent interface and aids discoverability, understanding and simplicity.

# SECTION 5 - Features Supporting Requirements:
1. Simplicity


# SECTION G - Feature Delivery Mechanism:
The module provides a data structure for passing search for filtering the data owner's collection.

# SECTION 7 - Dependencies:
* From `chess.system`:
    `Context`

* From Python `abc` Library:
    `ABC`

# SECTION 8 - Contains:
1. `SearchContext`
