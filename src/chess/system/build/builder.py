Module: chess.system.validate.validator

# SECTION 1 - Purpose:
1. This module provides a satisfaction of the `ChessBot` integrity requirement. The satisfaction covers
    enforcement of the minimum naming regulations in the system.
2. This module provides a satisfaction of the `ChessBot` reliability requirement.

# SECTION 2 - Scope:
The module covers name validation only.

# SECTION 3 - Limitations:
  1. The module does not provide permissible naming guidelines.
  2. Names that are allowed by the module might not meet additional restrictions other modules, classes, or processes
      have.

# SECTION 4 - Design Considerations and Themes:
Major themes influencing the design include:
1. Easy and fast debugging.
2. Single responsibility, single source of truth.


# SECTION 5 - Features Supporting Requirements:
1. No direct support for any user level features.
2. Direct support for reliability, verification, and integrity.
3. `NameValidator` can be used as component in more complex verifications.

# SECTION G - Feature Delivery Mechanism:
1. An exception for each requirement providing granular, accurate and precise error reporting.
2. Minimizing the boilerplate error handling and logging code with the `LoggingLevelRouter` decorator.

# SECTION 7 - Dependencies:
* From `chess.system`:
    `MIN_NAME_LENGTH`, `MAX_NAME_LENGTH`, `LongNameException`, `ShortNameException`, `BlankNameException`
    `NullNameException`, `Validator`,

* From Python `typing` Library:
    `cast`

# SECTION 8 - Contains:
1. `NameValidator`

* The limits of the module, defined by what it does not do.
* Where to look for related features this models does not provide because of its limitations.

# THEME:
* Highlight the core feature (thread-safety)
* Explain the how-and-why of implementation choices.

# PURPOSE:
* Function and role in the system.
* Why the module exists in the application architecture
