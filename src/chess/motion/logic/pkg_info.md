The Definition classes should only have static methods because shortest-line confirmations are stateless. The ids and names are only for putting them in dictonaries. These definitions should be usable anywehre. Definition gets at what the package is for but its not so much definng things but establishing tests that a certain motion fits a definiton based on the slope of the shortest line. These are predicates(logical expressions) so logic is a bette name for the package.""
