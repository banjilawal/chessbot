The Definition classes should only have static methods because shortest
-line confirmations are stateless. The ids and names are only for putting them
in dictonaries. These definitions should be usable anywehre. Definition gets at
what the package is for but its not so much definng things but establishing 
tests that a certain motion fits a definiton based on the slope of the shortest
line. These are predicates(logical expressions) so logic is a bette name for 
the package.

why I am psoting this note because these clases are just doing logic tests
a preicate that a shortest path betwewwn two points has the relationship 
between the points. 

I really like MotionTest though this is not motion but a test of thslpe or 
linegeometry I was concerned that MotionTest might be mistaked for a unt test.
LIneGeometryTest is a descriptive name fo rthe base class actually Iwas wrong
these are not testing just slope the KnightDefintion could be considered a 
path test they all could be but this is not really about paths its about a 
mapping r function from the origin that produces endpoints in one and only 
one codomain where everything is on-to not necessarily one-to-one if I am 
using the correct terminlogy
