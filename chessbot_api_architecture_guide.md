## Introduction
<a name="purpose-of-chessbot"></a>
### Purpose of ChessBot
ChessBot A High Performance In-Memory Chess Engine Intelligent Agent with Transactional Move Orchestration
, Centralize Validation and Reactive Notifications

ChesBot's teaching engine helps a novice who might feel intimidated by chess into a a 
confident, experienced player willing to take on everyone. ChessBot speeds up the learning curve
with different engines of different complexities. For each person's experience.

ChessBot is about fun chess. How can chess not be fun if a novice player has a good chance of beating 
the machine.

There is the play mode and the teaching mode where the engine plays thousands of games so it can find
patterns and gambits to show people step by step so they can gain mastery.




<a name="features-and-their-use-cases"></a>
## Features and Their Use Cases
When people ask what can they do with it. How does ChessBot give them what they need
even if they didn't know they need it before. The features are one liner saying
what is does and gives them what they need.

The big needs people
* Have are fun.
* Feeding their mastery.
* Discovering new things.
* Meeting new people.

Games give all those things. Chess gives people those things but chess is hard Chess is intimidating for
new people.. `ChessBot` eliminates the barriers and makes it easy to reup your game without anyone seeing 
what it was like to get there.

Those are big promises. Telling is not important. Showing is what counts. Telling people what `ChessBot`
promises to show during the valuable time they have are the features.

### What Do the USe Cases Do
Use cases give something concrete to grab onto. They give examples of ways people might want to use the
features. The use cases here are just a few examples. They are not exhaustive.

## Design Principles
The fundamental technical requirement to satisfy user contracts are
* High speed
* High reliability
* Low data usage
* Low bugs 
* No crashes.
* Correctness

#### Actions Which Produce the Technical Requirement
1. **Separating Concerns:** Easier bug tracking isolating components to speed up development.
2. **Low Coupling:** Components that depend on each other for satisfying their separated concerns must be
 loosely coupled.
3. **High Cohesion:** Between components that are doing related things or fulfilling a task.
4. **Single Responsibility:** There must be one source of truth for an operation or data source.

#### How the Development Actions Help Deliver a Product that Meets Requirement
* They make it easier to ensure effectiveness of each component with metrics.
* They make it easier to ensure reliability and consistency with unit tests.

### About Unit Tests
Every class will be unit tested on its fields and methods.


low bugs. These are easier to meet when an application is modular. And there is high cohesion within modules, low
coupling within and between modules.

The core design principle which meets the technical requirements is separation of concerns.

## 
## Architecture Overview
<a name="core-principles"></a>
### Core Principles
High performance
Lightweight 
Stable and reliable
Never looses data 
Playable on mobile, web, or desktop.

To achieve these the architecture has to be
- Modular for separating concerns, responsibilities and testing.
- Testable
- FAil gently/never crash
- If it crashes no data is lost and game play resumes where it left off.
- Games can be saved.

To achieve all these architecture implements rollbacks on failure. Separates data-holding objects 
from state/behavioral objects.

<a name="system-layers"></a>
### System Layers
The major layers are based on the core design principles of separating concerns into highly cohesive modules 
loosely coupled to each other.

1. Data
2. Business Logic
3. User Interface

Performance and reliability contracts are met with structures and operations that
1. Transfer state between layers.
2. Monitor and maintain consistency.
3. Dispatch request between components within and without layers and subsystems.
4. Send responses back to clients.




- Data protection and ACID; validators, transactions.
- Data creation; builders.
- Data transfer; results and events.
- Coordination; servers and controllers.

and which should be used publicly and which are interfaces to classes 
holding state.

## Core Patterns
The patterns are the responsibilities classes can have
1. Building
2. Validation
3. Data holding
4. Service request (Event)
5. Service provider (Transaction)
6. Service response (Transacti)

### Build Service Provider
Builder are responsible for safely creating entities. They perform comprehensive validation checks during construction
ensuring consistent patterns. Separating object creation provides a consistent workflow, flexibility, separates concerns. 

A builder runs through validation checks sequentially. If a check fails an `Exception` specific to that failure condition
is wrapped inside an `EntityBuildFailedException`. This speeds debugging and provides a single source of truth for an
object's build history.


    Performs individual validation checks on each component to ensure the resulting `Piece` meets all
    specifications. If all checks are passed, a `Piece` instance will be returned. It is not necessary to perform
    any additional validation checks on the returned `Piece` instance. This method guarantees if a `BuildResult`
    with a successful status is returned, the contained `Piece` is valid and ready for use.

1. Encapsulate complex logic with dependent entity validators
2. Simplify code.
3. Reduce boiler plate
4. Single source of truth for building errors by wrapping

### Validation Service Provider
*(placeholder for Validators explanation)*

```mermaid
%% Validator Flow Example
sequenceDiagram
  Event->>AttackEventValidator: Validate event legality
  AttackEventValidator-->>Event: Return ValidationResult
```

### Builders versus Validators
A `Builder` ensure objects are created correctly or not at all. An `Validator` ensures existing objects passes around
the system passed sanity checks.

      The build runs through all the checks on parameters and state to guarantee only a valid `Piece` is
      created, while `PieceValidator` is used for validating `Piece` instances that are passed around after
      creating. This separation of concerns makes the validation and building independent of each other and
      simplifies maintenance.

### Recommended Builder Workflow
```python
from chess.team import Team
from chess.rank import Knight
from chess.piece import CombatantPiece, PieceBuilder
build_result = PieceBuilder.build(name="WN2", rank=Knight(), team=white_team)
if not build_result.is_success():
  raise build_result.exception

piece = cast(CombatantPiece, build_result.payload)
```
### Sequence Diagram for the Usage Example
```mermaid
%% Builder Flow Example
sequenceDiagram
  User->>CommanderBuilder: Request new Commander
  CommanderBuilder->>IdValidator: Validate ID
  CommanderBuilder->>NameValidator: Validate Name
  CommanderBuilder-->>User: Return BuildResult with Commander
```

### See Also:
 - `Validator`: Used for validating existing objects
 - `BuildResult[`T`]`: Return type containing the built `T` or exception information


#### Transaction Service Request (`Event`) The 
  A data-holding object representing an`actor`'s intent to perform a state-changing operation with a
  `resource`. An `Event` is passed to a `Transaction` instance that fires and manages the event lifecycle.
  During the event lifecycle the `actor` manipulates the `resource`.

# PURPOSE
A package providing an immutable hierarchy for events and transactions manging event lifecycle. An event is
 an object representing an intent to perform a state-changing operation with a resource by an actor.
 Each event lifecycle is managed by a `Transaction` instance.

 ACID transactions are a functional requirement for the chess game. The `Transaction` class rolls back actors
 and resources if there is a data inconsistency a `RollBackException` is raised after `actor` and `resource` are
 restored to their last good state.

# Notes:
  DO NOT USE THESE EXCEPTIONS DIRECTLY. Limited use in the finally statement of a try-except block.


### Results
Operations and methods that return data raise exceptions if inputs break business rules or 
run into edge cases. Raising exceptions crashes the application which violates a core feature.

#### Policy for Fulfilling Reliability Requirement
Return exceptions to the caller for soft handling or rolling back.

#### Mechanism for Policy Enforcement
`Result` Abstract Data Type that holds data returned from accessor method or exception it threw.
`Result` is the super class for all data-holding objets which represent outcome of operations that 
produce one of two results only.
 1. Success: A payload is returned
 2. Failure: An exception is raised

#### Source Package and Importing
- `chess.system.result

##### Importing `Result` Class
Do not import the terminal package. This will be messy and difficult to keep track of. Each 

##### Fields
 * `_payload` (`Optional`[`T`]): The payload of the result, if the operation called.
 * `_exception` (`Optional`[`Exception`]): The error raised if the operation called failed.

##### Methods
 * `is_success()` -> `bool`: Returns True if the result is successful (i.e., has a payload only).

 A Result object encapsulates the outcome of methods and operations that return an object. Different from
 TransactionResult which assures an existing object's state changed correctly without causing inconsistencies.

##### RECOMMENDED USE CASES
 * Validation of existing objects.
 * Objects returned by accessors and query methods.
 * Operations that return an object, but may fail due to business logic or other reasons.
 * Methods that may fail due to external factors (e.g., network issues, file I

### Exceptions
Conditions which violate business logic, raise data inconsistencies or break operations raise an exception.
Exceptions aid bug tracking and maintenance. Exceptions can only break the system in development. In production
an exception will display a notification and return to the last good state after the user makes a choice. All
exceptions in the application are subclasses of `ChessException`. This distinguishes `ChessBot` exceptions from 
others.

#### The `ChessException` Class
The class has two static fields.
 - `ERROR_CODE` (`str`): Useful in log tracing. Error codes have the <i>_ERROR</i> suffix.
 - `DEFAULT_MESSAGE` (`str`): Sentence describing the condition that raised the `ChessException`.

The `DEFAULT_MESSAGE` should be used when a `ChessException` is raised. This gives consistency and cuts down on
work. All subclasses must have an `ERROR_CODE` and `DEFAULT_MESSAGE`

#### Direct Subclasses of `ChessException`
* `FailedBuildException`
* `ValidationException`
* `PieceException`
* `TeamException`
* `CoordException`
* `CommanderException`
* `BoardException`
* `SquareException`
* `NullException`
* `RollbackException`
* `EventException`
* `SearchException`
* `TransactioException`
* `ScalarExecption`
* `VectorException`
* `MovingException`
* `AreanException`

All the exceptions have the same static fields `ERROR_CODE` and `DEFAULT_MESSAGE`. Classes that carry results;
`Result`, `BuildResult`, `ValidationResult`, `TransactionResult` and 'SearchResult` may only raise exceptions
about mutual exclusion requirements in their fields.'


#### The Exception Workflow
There isn't anything different different about raising and catching `ChessException`s. I just want to illustrate
how the error code and default message should be used.
---
```python

# import the ChessException from chess.system
from chess.system import ChessException 

# Create the subclass
class RollbackFailedException(ChessException):
  ERROR_CODE = "ROLLBACK_FAILED_ERROR"
  DEFAULT_MESSAGE = "Rollback failed."

# Using the custom exception
def handle_fault(rolled_back_data, original_data):
  if not rolled_back_data == original_data:
    raise RollbackFailedException(RollbackFailedException.DEFAULT_MESSAGE)
```
---
Note the default message is used when creating an exception instance, not the error code. The error code
is used in searching the logs.
